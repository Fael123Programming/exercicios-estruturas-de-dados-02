/** CountingSort goes from the fact that an array has its positions always sorted!!!
 * From 0 through its size subtracted one.
 * Let a[] = {1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 5, 6, 7, 5, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1};
 * k = 7 (the greatest value of 'a');
 * n = 17 (size of 'a');
 * The following properties for 'a', are true:
 * Let i = 0, 1, ..., (n - 1), then a[i] <= k
 * Firstly, a[i] âˆˆ N (if there are negative numbers, another steps must be made!).
 * Now let count be an array of size k + 1: it varies from position 0 through k.
 * In each position of count we should put the frequency of the value in each position in array 'a'.
 *                             0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 * It will go like: count[] = {4, 5, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1}.
 * Update count such that count[i + 1] += count[i] to get the right positions to insert the
 * keys into the new sorted array. 'count' will be {4, 9, 12, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17}.
 * Now, check lines 61 forward to know the next steps of this algorithm.
 * Final cost: O(n + k) in so that n = size of 'a' and k = max(a).
 * Let max(array) be a function that returns the maximum value found in an array.
 * Drawbacks:
 * -> In general, this algorithm cannot be applied on negative or floating-point keys!
 *  Even so, you can modify the algorithm to do so.
 * -> If k is too big, time and space complexity will be a polynomial in order of n ^ r where r > 1.

//      -> Access the key at position 'i' in numbers;
//      -> With this key value, check the position in 'count' indexed by this very same value;
//      -> Decrease the value found there to get the actual position the key may be inserted in 'sorted';
//      -> Access 'sorted' with this decreased value and assign to it the key found in numbers[i];
//      -> If we had to normalize 'numbers' (because there was found at least one negative key), we have
//      to subtract the updated key in numbers by the absolute value of mostNegative. See that in line 41
//      we multiplied mostNegative by -1 to put it as its absolute value.
//      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
//      Now, we have got to copy 'sorted' into 'numbers'!
